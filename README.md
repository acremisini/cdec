# Cross Document Event Coreference (CDEC)

Code to perform CDEC, which is the task of clustering event mentions in a collection
of documents that refer to the same real-world event. Depends on Stanford CoreNLP,
and pre-trained Fasttext vectors. Configured to do CDEC on the ECB+ corpus.
Only uses event trigger annotations.

Project will be fully documented by Jan. 2020.
